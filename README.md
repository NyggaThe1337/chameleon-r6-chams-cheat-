so basically some pasters & skids that don't know how to code are selling this

run injector before opening game then type dll name hit enter then (ex: chams.dll)
Then open game (don't hit ok) when in lobby hit ok then cheat will load keep hitting ok

you can use any dll there idk why these skids are selling this

There's a few dll's with different colours the original source for the dll is available on github


### **How to Use:**

1. **Run the Injector** before opening the game.
2. **Enter the DLL name** (e.g., `chams.dll`) and hit **Enter**.
3. **Open the Game** but don't hit OK yet.
4. Once you're in the lobby, **hit OK** in the injector, and the cheat will load.
5. Keep hitting OK as needed.
